## How to Contribute

### 🐛 Reporting Bugs

Before opening a new bug report, please search [existing issues](https://github.com/rahul3rj/Project-OS/issues) to avoid duplicates.

When filing a bug, include:
- **What happened** — describe the problem clearly
- **Steps to reproduce** — a minimal reproduction is ideal
- **Expected behaviour** — what should have happened
- **Environment** — OS, Chrome version, Node.js version
- **Screenshots / recordings** — if applicable

Use the **Bug Report** issue template.

---

### 💡 Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome! Open an issue with the **Feature Request** template and include:
- **Problem statement** — what pain point does this address?
- **Proposed solution** — how you envision the feature
- **Alternatives considered** — other approaches you thought of
- **Mockups / examples** — if you have them

---

### 📦 Pull Requests

- PRs should be focused and atomic — one feature or fix per PR
- Make sure the extension **builds successfully** before submitting:
  ```bash
  cd Frontend
  npm run build
  ```
- Ensure ESLint passes:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
- Update any relevant documentation (README, inline comments)
- Link your PR to the issue it closes using `Closes #<issue-number>`

---

## Development Setup

### Extension (Frontend)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
cd Frontend
npm install

# 2. Run in dev mode (UI testing only)
npm run dev

# 3. Build the extension
npm run build
```

Load `Frontend/dist` as an **unpacked extension** in `chrome://extensions`.

### Landing Website (web)

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Branch Naming Convention

Use the following prefixes for branch names:

| Prefix | Use for |
|:---|:---|
| `feat/` | New feature |
| `fix/` | Bug fix |
| `docs/` | Documentation changes |
| `refactor/` | Code restructuring (no feature/fix) |
| `chore/` | Build tooling, dependencies, config |
| `style/` | CSS/UI-only changes |

**Examples:**
```
feat/dark-light-toggle
fix/water-tracker-reset
docs/update-readme
chore/upgrade-vite-v8
```

---

## Commit Message Convention

We follow **Conventional Commits**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer: Closes #<issue>]
```

**Types:**

| Type | When to use |
|:---|:---|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation changes only |
| `style` | Formatting, CSS, no logic change |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Build process, dependencies, tooling |

**Examples:**
```
feat(timer): add long break interval support
fix(water): reset daily log at UTC midnight
docs(readme): add star history chart
chore(deps): upgrade @dnd-kit/core to v7
```

---

## Code Style

- **JavaScript / JSX** — follow the existing ESLint config (`eslint.config.js`)
- **CSS** — use Tailwind utility classes where possible; use vanilla CSS for theme-specific overrides in `themes/`
- **Imports** — group in order: React → third-party → local components → utils
- **Component files** — one component per file, named with PascalCase
- **No console.log** in production code — remove debug logs before submitting a PR

Run the linter before committing:
```bash
npm run lint
```

---

## Adding a New Widget

Widgets live in `Frontend/src/components/`. To add a new one:

1. **Create** `Frontend/src/components/YourWidget.jsx`
2. **Register** it in `DashboardGrid.jsx` — add it to the widget map and default layout
3. **Add a toggle setting** in `App.jsx` (STORAGE key + state)
4. **Wire up the settings** in `SettingsPage.jsx`
5. **Test** it thoroughly in both Dashboard Grid mode and Hero View mode
6. **Update** `README.md` features table with a brief description

---
